# monthly-wage-calculation

Reads in a csv file and calculates monthly wages based on the shifts in the file. 

## How to use

Find the newest .jar in releases. When you run it, it'll ask you to select a file.  
There's an [hourlist.csv](res/hourlist.csv) that should give you a pretty good idea about how the input should be formatted.  
When you select a file through the dialog, an output file with the wages will be created in the same directory where the .jar is.

Built with Kotlin/JVM.
